R324B060047,"Publications addressing the efficacy of sequential implementation of two types of ADHD interventions: behavioral modification and medication
Setting:  The participants will come primarily from urban and suburban communities in Western New York.
Population:  A total of 144 children between the ages of 6-12 with ADHD will participate. It is expected that approximately 10% of the referrals will be girls.  Treatment will take place in general education classrooms.  Exclusionary criteria include (1) children with Full Scale IQ below 70, (2) children with a history of seizures or other neurological problems and/or taking medication to prevent seizures, (3) children with a history of other medical problems for whom psychostimulant treatment may involve considerable risk, (4) children with a childhood history or concurrent diagnosis of any of the following disorders: pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, sexual disorder, organic mental disorder, or eating disorder; (5) children who do not exhibit functional impairment; and (6) children who are currently in special education.
Intervention:  Treatment is at the student level where students are randomized to 1 of 2 adaptive treatment strategies:  (1) Low dose stimulant medication or (2) School-based behavioral intervention (e.g., daily report card and supporting parent education).  Children who are inadequate responders to their assigned treatment strategy will be further randomized to either (a) augment the initial treatment (e.g., increase dose of medication, add higher-intensity behavioral treatment) or (b) move to a combined treatment by adding the other treatment component.
Research Design and Methods:  A randomized group design will be used with students as the unit of randomization; three sequential cohorts will be recruited.  Most study measures will be conducted at pre-, post-, and follow-up, with monthly behavior ratings completed by parents and teachers as a way to measure progress.
Control Condition:  This is an adaptive treatment design, where students are randomized to one of two treatment groups, with further randomization for nonresponders.  Comparisons will be made within and across treatment groups.  
Key Measures: A number of instruments will be utilized to gather diagnostic and assessment information including parent and teacher ratings and narrative descriptions of the child, a clinical interview with the parents to obtain childhood educational and developmental history, measures of peer relations and classroom behavior ratings.  Additionally, information regarding treatment acceptability, parental psychopathology, and use of behavioral techniques in the home and at school will be collected.  Whenever the father is involved with the child, ratings will be collected from both the mother and father. Information about students' IQ and academic achievement will also be collected.  Researchers are using primarily well-established standardized clinical and educational measures.
Data Analytic Strategy:  Because analysis of adaptive treatments treats the entire treatment bundle as a whole, group comparisons will be performed according to typical group analysis.  Moderators (previous treatment, SES, ethnicity, gender, age) and mediators (interim response to treatment, treatment dosing, parent or teacher characteristics, teacher/child relationship) will also be evaluated.  Many hypotheses will be addressed using mixed model ANOVA to accommodate the interdependence that exists between measurements taken from the same subjects over time.  A treatment cost-effectiveness analysis will also be conducted.

Structured Abstract
Setting: These studies will take place in suburban public high schools in Hillsborough County, Florida.
Population: Participating students will be enrolled in Algebra 1. In the participating school district, 57 percent of students receive a free or reduced-price lunch, and 59 percent are racial minorities.
Intervention: The intervention will be a set of materials with interleaved practice problems drawn from textbooks already in use by teachers. These materials will be developed iteratively and will incorporate the optimal configuration based on a series of considered features. These features include different spacing intervals between the topics and number of practice problems.  A second feature will be the difficulty posed by problems themselves, using an approach called incremental development"" (i.e., showing students simpler problems on a topic before giving them harder ones). A third feature pertains to the use of superficially-similar problems that actually demand different strategies, and a fourth is the use of just-in-time review problems (i.e., when the skills needed to solve a problem are actually presented in the subsequent topic). 
Research Design and Methods: The researchers will use the practice problems in the textbooks already in use in the classroom. They will create workbooks with different types of orderings and gather evidence about the feasibility of using the materials and the effects of the different types of orderings. During the development process, they will also conduct three semester-long, classroom-based, fully embedded experiments. The three studies will be conducted in the spring semesters of three consecutive years. For each study, they will create a workbook with problems drawn from the students' regular textbook, but the practice problems will be rearranged in one or both conditions. Half of the practice problems completed by each student will include one type of interleaving, and the other half will include a different type (or standard assignments). Otherwise, the course is unchanged. Students will be taught only by their teachers, who will present topics as they ordinarily would. The three experiments will explore the effects of: (1) the number of practice problems interleaved, (2) the effect of providing solved examples as part of homework, and (3) the efficacy of standard practice assignments with those with interleaved practice. In each proposed study, they will compare two kinds of practice assignments by using a repeated-measures, counterbalanced, crossover design.
Control Condition: In the control condition for the Year 3 pilot study, students will receive assignments from their regular textbook in the same order as presented in the textbook.
Key Measures: The key measures will include pretest-posttest gains and posttest-posttest gains that is the difference between one posttest and the next posttest. There will be three posttests: one at the end of the school year; one on the first day of the following school year, approximately 14 weeks later; and a third posttest administered 1 year later depending on the students' subsequent mathematics course. The posttests will consist of two kinds of items: problems exactly like some of the problems appearing in their assignments (but with different numerical values) and problems requiring at least a moderate degree of transfer. The transfer problems will be drawn from standardized exams, such as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS), Orleans-Hanna Algebra Prognosis Test, California Achievement Tests (CAT), and the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT). Other performance measures include scores on quarterly exams and students' accuracy and effort on practice problems. Finally, students and teachers will provide self-report preferences (e.g., Which kind of practice assignment did you prefer?) and metacognitive judgments (e.g., Which of the two kinds of assignments will better help you when you return for a test?).
Data Analytic Strategy: Researchers will compare both the difference in pretest-posttest gains and the difference in posttest scores between the two practice strategies. They will also conduct analyses to determine whether moderator variables, such as student ability, had an effect.

Structured Abstract
Setting: The project will be set in middle schools in the Boston public school system.
Population: Ten teachers in their first year of implementing the CME Project and 2 to 6 coaches will participate in the initial two development cycles. The coaches will be trained by the developers of the project, and will also be professional development facilitators for the teachers. In the third year pilot-study, a sample of 40 8th-grade algebra 1 teachers will be recruited to participate in the program. Of these 40 teachers, 24 will participate in the LTA intervention and 16 will serve as a comparison group. The number of coaches will remain the same. The student sample will consist of approximately 400 students.
Intervention: LTA is a comprehensive approach to professional development with the goal of building teachers' mathematical understanding and practices. LTA builds on the research team's prior work developing the Center for Mathematics Education CME Project Algebra 1 course, part of a four year high school curriculum. The CME Project includes a professional development program for coaches that will serve as a model for development activities in this project.  LTA will include two components: (1) a professional development program for teachers, including a detailed implementation guide, model lessons, pacing guides, and assessments, all aligned with CCSS; and (2) a professional development program for coaches, including mathematical background for coaches, strategies for setting up teacher discussion groups, and essays by existing coaches.
Research Design and Methods: The project will use an iterative process of testing and refinement of materials carried out over 3 years. In Phase 1, the team will develop draft materials and instruments, pilot test the materials with the first cohort of teachers, and make revisions of the materials and instruments based on the findings of the pilot test. Researchers will continue revisions of the materials based on the pilot test and field testing in Phase 2. During Phase 3, the research team will carry out a quasi-experimental research design to test the potential effects of the materials on teacher and student outcomes, and will disseminate materials and study results. Coaches will receive professional development and act as facilitators during all three phases.
Control Condition: The third year quasi-experimental pilot study will include a comparison group. The comparison group will not receive professional development.
Key Measures: During development, researchers will collect data on the quality of the materials, teacher delivery, how teachers' learning is aligned to observed practices, and teachers' ability to model mathematical thinking in their algebra classes. During the pilot study, researchers will assess changes in teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching. The instruments will include two assessments of teachers' knowledge of mathematics for teaching (the Mathematical Practices Assessment and the Knowledge of Algebra for Teaching Assessment) and one observation protocol (the Instructional Quality Assessment) designed to assess instructional strategies incorporating mathematical practices. Also, researchers will use in-class assessments developed for Chicago public schools to gauge students' understanding of algebraic concepts.
Data Analytic Strategy: Qualitative data from the iterative development process will be coded for specific themes related to the quality and feasibility of the three components of LTA.  A quasi experimental research design will be implemented and quantitative data from the pilot study will be analyzed using linear regression.

Structured Abstract
Setting: The project will take place in Indiana and Virginia.
Population: The sample population will include about 520 students taking 9th or 10th grade algebra classes at a rural high school, as well as 300 college undergraduates taking remedial algebra courses.
Intervention: The intervention being developed is Pushing Symbols, a software tool that allows students to interact physically and dynamically with expression elements (e.g., by dragging a number on an interactive screen to the other side of an equation, causing the addition operator to become a subtraction operator) to provide a potentially powerful source of perceptual-motor experiences. This will then lead to rapid acquisition of object-centered understandings of algebra. Rather than simply rewriting algebraic expressions in a step-wise fashion, in Pushing Symbols learners can directly interact with dynamic expression objects. In addition to the computer-based visualization tool, the intervention will also include a set of in-class discussion guides and paper-and-pencil activities.
Research Design and Methods: The research team will follow an iterative process in which they generate materials and software and test prototypes of the system in various stages of completeness. The data collected in each round of collection will be used for design improvements. First, prototypes will be tested for usability and technical soundness with college undergraduates at the University of Richmond in remedial mathematics courses. Second, the team will build prototypes of the intervention components using a variety of different, cognitively plausible models of learning, such as perception or visually based learning. To determine which models are most valid and useful, the researchers will conduct a series of experimental studies with both college and high school students, focusing on the kinds of rules and transformations that are most problematic for students. In these experiments, the researchers will study the role of perception-action grounding in acquiring symbolic reasoning skills. Alternative versions of the Pushing Symbols system will explore the role of perceptual scaffolding, visual hints to structure, and sequencing instruction to introduce or remove perceptual supports. For example, perceptual scaffolding, such as the spacing between operators and numbers (e.g., 3+2 * 4 versus 3 + 2*4), may help students to perform operations in the correct order. These experiments will inform not only the development of Pushing Symbols but also other instructional systems that can strategically introduce or remove perceptual, conceptual, and interaction supports. During the final stage in development (Year 3), the software and supporting materials will be piloted in a small town high school in Indiana. This piloting will help assess the feasibility of implementing the system as well as the promise of the intervention's potential success.
Key Measures:  Key measures include researcher-developed assessments of perceptual learning of algebraic structures, problem-solving ability (procedural fluency), and conceptual understanding.
Data Analytic Strategy: In the pilot study, the pre-test, post-test, and retention test will be analyzed using an analysis of variance to statistically evaluate improvement.

Structured Abstract
Setting: The study will take place in two school districts in California.
Population: Participants include ELLs in grades 2 through 8 who will be followed for 4 years. In the 2008–09 school year, 25 percent of students in one district were ELLs, and 32 percent of students in grades 2 through 8 were ELLs in the other district.
Intervention: There is no intervention.
Research Design and Methods: Researchers will use a multimethod design combined with quantitative and qualitative analytic strategies to complete an in-depth longitudinal and cross-sectional view of ELLs in grades 2 through 8 at baseline and 6 through 12 at completion. The research team will use a regression discontinuity design to explore the relation between reclassification and achievement outcomes. Researchers will begin with retrospective data (a baseline year followed by the initial reclassification decision year) and follow students for an additional 3 years. To document the apparent discrepancy between the substantial percentage of ELLs who meet state-specified minimum English proficiency and achievement criteria and the much smaller percentage who are Reclassified as Fluent English Proficient (RFEP), researchers will analyze student-level English proficiency, achievement, and reclassification decision data. Using demographic, language, and baseline achievement data, researchers will explore similarities and differences among the students who meet these criteria and are reclassified and those who meet criteria and are not reclassified). To examine factors that facilitate or prevent reclassification and the curricular access consequences of being reclassified or not, researchers will conduct document reviews and interviews of district and school staff regarding ELL policies, practices, and instructional programs. Additionally, the research team will also examine reclassification decision forms for selected cohorts, and examine student course-taking patterns.
Control Condition: There is no control condition.
Key Measures: Researchers will gather quantitative and qualitative data to answer the core research questions. Key measures include student demographics, California English Language Development Test (CELDT); California State Test of English Language Arts; reclassification decision data; student performance on reclassification criteria; California State Test of Mathematics; credits earned; GPA, college-prep and AP course taking; California High School exit exams; high school completion; and attendance. District and school staff interviews regarding ELL classification, reclassification, instructional placement policies and practices, and core curricular access will also be evaluated.
Data Analytic Strategy: Descriptive and correlational analyses as well as regression discontinuity design will be used to explore the relation between reclassification and achievement outcomes, taking into account prior achievement and demographic characteristics. Subgroup analyses will also be conducted that investigate the relationship between reclassification status and academic achievement based on proximity to the cut score for reclassification. An event history/survival analysis will examine the baseline factors that are related to students' odds of being reclassified over a 4-year period. Analysis of quantitative and qualitative data triangulated across sources of data and informants will be used to describe ELL district policies and procedures regarding reclassification, factors that facilitate and prevent reclassification, and access to the core curriculum.

Structured Abstract
Setting: The development of the online game will take place at the University of Southern California Game Innovation Lab. It will include input from 8th grade and 11th grade students from nearby middle and high schools.
Population: The development, feasibility testing, and piloting of Pathfinder will be done with 8th graders at three middle schools and 11th graders at three high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District. These schools are primarily composed of Title I minority students.
Intervention: The intervention will have three components: an online high school version, a middle school version, and supports for school staff. The online version of the high school Pathfinder card game will have players guide a character through class and activity selection, time management challenges, putting together application materials, and acquiring the financial resources to afford college and its related costs. Games are to take about a week to complete and will require 5–10 minutes at a time to advance the game. The goal of the game is not only to be accepted but also to be able to afford and be prepared to succeed at the player's college of choice. Students can repeat play the game using characters with different backgrounds.
The middle school version of the game will emphasize development of college-going aspirations and use connections between education and careers to stress the importance of doing well in middle school. Students will learn that their performance in middle school affects high school options that ultimately influence college and career choices. A combination of tools such as graphic novels, board games, and online games will be developed for middle school students.
The counselor/teacher component will include: (1) lesson plans and activities that facilitate use of the card and online games in the classroom; (2) professional development activities for teachers interested in incorporating college guidance into their curriculum; and (3) a dual-faceted mentoring component where counselors mentor teachers and both groups mentor students.
Research Design and Methods:  Throughout the development of Pathfinder, the designers will work with student focus groups in order to revise prototypes of the game. A feasibility study for the online version of Pathfinder (at both the high school and middle school levels and including teacher/counselor supplements) will be carried out in one middle school and one high school classroom. The purpose of the feasibility study will be to examine the usability of the intervention in the classroom. Data on feasibility of use will be collect through: (1) a teacher interview that determines the feasibility of using the online game in the classroom; (2) a student focus group interview (with 10 students); (3) a user satisfaction questionnaire (all feasibility study participants); and (4) a counselor interview regarding how the counselor/teacher component can be used in the counselor's daily work. These data will inform adjustments in the online version of the game prior to implementing the pilot study.
The pilot study will include approximately 600 students and their teachers from 8th and 11th grade English courses at three middle and three high schools. Data will be collected using: (1) observations of game play environments inside of school and virtually beyond school in the Facebook application; (2) focus groups with 10 students at each school at 3 different points during each school year; (3) collection of pre- and post-measures of college going procedures, knowledge of college, digital learning, motivation to attend college, problem solving, critical thinking abilities, and game content;  (4) user satisfaction questionnaires collected from teachers, counselors, and students; and (5) interviews with teachers/counselors (approximately 60 interviews).
Key Measures:  Quantitative instruments to be used include: (1) the Student Digital Learning Concept Inventory, a 4-point multiple choice type questionnaire to assess student knowledge of critical elements of digital media; (2) the Student College Going Concept Inventory, a 4-point multiple choice type questionnaire to assess student knowledge of critical elements of accessing college; (3) the College Self-Efficacy Scale (CSEI), a 20- item measure of an individual's sense of perceived college self-efficacy on an 11-point Likert-type scale; (4) a User Satisfaction Questionnaire that uses a 4-point Likert type scale measuring user satisfaction; and (5) the Student Application Incidence that includes a summation of high school students' applications to college. Qualitative data will be gathered through student focus groups, teacher and counselor interviews, and observations of students playing Pathfinder.
Data Analytic Strategy:  Mixed methods are used in the analysis. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all the quantitative instruments and multivariate techniques will be used to model the relationships of the variable. Interview and observational data will be coded and thematically categorized using the constant comparative method. Special attention will be paid to disconfirming evidence and outliers, as well as elements of frequency, extensiveness, and intensity.
